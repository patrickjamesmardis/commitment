### ATLS 4519 | Creative Web Development
I took this assignment as an opportunity to explore [Greensock's gsap](https://greensock.com/), bringing a "stream-of-consciousness" approach to the ```gsap.timeline()```. I was introduced to gsap in an "Animation for the Web" course through [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/courses/animation-for-the-web-svg-css-and-javascript) during winter break.
