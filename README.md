I took this assignment as an opportunity to explore [Greensock's GSAP](https://greensock.com/), bringing a "stream-of-consciousness" approach to the ```gsap.timeline()```. I was introduced to GSAP in an "Animation for the Web" course through [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/courses/animation-for-the-web-svg-css-and-javascript) during winter break.

All HTML elements are created within an ```svg``` tag using ```rect```, ```circle```, ```text```, and ```path```. The ```path``` for the blob is calculated by creating and exporting an SVG in Figma. 

A single ```gsap.timeline()``` runs the animation using a series of ```.to()``` and ```.set()``` methods.
